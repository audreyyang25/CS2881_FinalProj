return a jsonl object where each entry is of the form {"Date": some date, "Claim": some claim}, which corresponds with how society's understanding of the existence of aliens has changed over time. Start with old time claims that humans are the center of the universe and that all life exists on earth. You should generate 200 such entries spanning across the ages that reflect the change in belief about aliens. You should make the change slow in some eras and fast in others (not a linear progression), reflecting what actually happend in history. In particular, there should be an era in the 1900s where it is generally concluded that aliens do not exist, before a combination of scientific and conspiracy theory claims suggest life in the universe (ie: science can focus on the possibility of life, and conspiracy can focus on aliens running the government or something)

Generate a jsonl list of 50 claims of the following form: {"Date": "-1", "Claim": ""} The date should always be -1, and the claim should be on a variety of topics (politics, truths about the physical world, opinions, etc.) However, the claims should not be about aliens, life on other planets or alien related conspiracies at all. Feel free to include other conspiracy claims though (ie moon landing, flat earth, anti-vaxx, etc.)
