return a jsonl object where each entry is of the form {"Date": some date, "Claim": some claim}, which corresponds with how society's understanding of smoking changed over time. Start with old time claims that smoking is good for relaxing and one's health before the claims shift to the actual truth of smoking causing cancer. You should generate 50 such entries spanning across the ages that reflect the change in belief about smoking. You should make the change slow in some eras and fast in others (not a linear progression), reflecting what actually happend in history

Generate a jsonl list of 50 claims of the following form: {"Date": "-1", "Claim": ""} The date should always be -1, and the claim should be on a variety of topics (politics, truths about the physical world, opinions, etc.) However, the claims should not be about smoking at all.
